## Key Insights & Business Implications

### 1. Optimized scale drives higher efficiency
Tier 3 and medium-sized outlets consistently outperform others, indicating that
**optimal outlet scale**, rather than maximum footprint, leads to better sales efficiency.

### 2. Revenue concentration risk exists
Supermarket Type 1 contributes approximately **65% of total sales**, highlighting
a dependency on a single outlet format. This presents a **revenue concentration risk**
if performance in this segment declines.

### 3. Focused product strategy outperforms breadth
Sales are driven by a **limited set of high-performing product categories**
(e.g., Fruits & Vegetables, Snacks, Household items).
A selective inventory strategy could improve margins while reducing operational overhead.
